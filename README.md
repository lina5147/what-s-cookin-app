## What's Cookin' App

The problem I run into on a daily bases is "what are we eating for lunch/dinner?" or "What are we cooking today?" I created this app to help others who run into this problem too. Based on the ingredients you have in the kitchen, What's Cookin' can help populate possible recipes you can make.

I developed this app over the course of three weeks as my capstone project at Ada Developer's Academy.

### App Features

- A user can enter ingredients they currently have in the kitchen into an ingredient list and search for recipes based on those ingredients.
- Along with the recipes will include additional ingredients needed to make the recipe.
- A user can view the full recipe including the ingredients and instructions.
- A user can save recipes to favorites.
